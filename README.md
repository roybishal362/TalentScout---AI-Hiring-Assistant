## üìñ Usage Guide

### Getting Started
1. **Launch the App**: Run the Streamlit application
2. **Enter API Key**: Input your Groq API key in the sidebar (if not set as environment variable)
3. **Start Interview**: Click "Start Interview" to begin the conversation
4. **Follow Prompts**: Answer the questions as the chatbot guides you through the process

### Conversation Flow
1. **Greeting & Overview**: Chatbot introduces itself and explains the process
2. **Personal Information**: Collects name, email, phone, experience, position, and location
3. **Tech Stack Declaration**: Candidate specifies their technical skills
4. **Technical Questions**: 4 tailored questions based on declared tech stack
5. **Completion**: Summary of information and next steps

### Ending Conversation
Use keywords like: `bye`, `goodbye`, `exit`, `quit`, `end`, `finish`, `done`, `thank you`

### Data Export
- View collected information in the sidebar
- Click "Download Candidate Data" to export as CSV

## üé® Prompt Engineering Strategy

### Information Extraction Prompts
```python
# Example prompt for extracting candidate information
"""Extract the {field} from the following text. Return only the extracted value, nothing else.
If the information is not found, return 'NOT_FOUND'.

Text: {text}
Field to extract: {field}"""
```

### Technical Question Generation
```python
# Prompt for generating tech-specific questions
"""Generate 4 technical questions for a candidate based on their tech stack.
The questions should be relevant, practical, and assess different aspects of their knowledge.

Tech Stack: {tech_stack}

Requirements:
- Questions should be clear and specific
- Cover different difficulty levels (basic to intermediate)
- Focus on practical application, not just theory"""
```

### Design Principles
- **Clear Instructions**: Specific, unambiguous prompts
- **Context Preservation**: Maintaining conversation context across interactions
- **Fallback Handling**: Graceful degradation when AI features are unavailable
- **Output Formatting**: Structured responses for consistent parsing

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### State Management
```python
class HiringAssistant:
    def __init__(self):
        self.conversation_state = "greeting"
        self.candidate_info = {}
        self.tech_questions = []
        self.current_question_index = 0
```

### LLM Integration
- **Model**: LLaMA 3 70B via Groq API
- **Temperature**: 0.1 (for consistent, focused responses)
- **Framework**: LangChain for prompt management
- **Fallback**: Graceful degradation when API is unavailable

### Data Privacy & Security
- **No Persistent Storage**: Data exists only during session
- **Input Validation**: Basic email format validation
- **Secure API Handling**: API keys managed through environment variables

## üöß Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Context Management
**Problem**: Maintaining conversation context across multiple user interactions
**Solution**: Implemented state machine pattern with clear conversation states and context preservation

### Challenge 2: Dynamic Question Generation
**Problem**: Creating relevant questions for diverse tech stacks
